\title{Minc Voxel Summary Functions}
\usage{
mincMean(filenames, grouping = NULL, mask = NULL, maskval = NULL)

mincVar(filenames, grouping = NULL, mask = NULL, maskval = NULL)

mincSum(filenames, grouping = NULL, mask = NULL, maskval = NULL)

mincSd(filenames, grouping = NULL, mask = NULL, maskval = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{filenames}{Filenames of the MINC volumes across which to create the
descriptive statistic.}

\item{grouping}{Optional grouping - contains same number of elements as
filenames; the results will then have the descriptive
statistic computed separately for each group.}

\item{mask}{A mask specifying which voxels are to be included in the
summary.}
}
\value{
The output will be a single vector containing as many
         elements as there are voxels in the input files. If a
         grouping factor was specified then the output will be a
         matrix consisiting of as many rows as there were voxels in
         the files, and as many columns as there were groups.
}
\description{
Compute the mean, standard deviation, sum, or variance at every voxel across a
a set of MINC volumes.
An optional grouping variable will split the computation by group
rather than performing it across all volumes as is the default.
