\section{Running arbitrary R functions}

RMINC has the capacity to run arbitrary R functions at ever voxel of a
set of files. This comes in quite handy when there are no easily
wrapped functions that exist in RMINC but there is some existing R
module you would like to try out. Some words of caution are in order,
however:

\begin{itemize}
\item Running arbitrary functions involves writing your own small R
  function to wrap the code you want to use, which is a bit ugly.
\item It is slow. Slower than molasses on a cold Georgia winter
  morning.
\end{itemize}

Here's an example of how it works:


The code above has two parts. The first is creating the function,
which has the following properties:

\begin{itemize}
\item It takes no arguments.
\item It works on the variable \textit{x}. This function will be
  evaluated at every voxel, where \textit{x} will be a vector
  containing the values at that voxel for all the files.
\item It returns a vector.
\end{itemize}
