	* The most popular/default behaviour of anatGetAll (getting volume information about the structures in Adrienne Dorr's mouse brain atlas using the c57_brain_atlas_labels.csv) has changed because of the previous commit (dropping label 0 by default). To regain default behaviour, the flag dropLabels for anatGetAll is now set to TRUE by default.

	* The function AnatGetAll gets information about labels/segmentations for a list of input files. By default the label 0 (background) was added to the list of labels that would be returned by the function. This caused some issues when the parameter dropLabels was set to True. So now label 0 is not added to the list of labels by default anymore. If you care about the background, you will need to add 0 (for left and right) to your definitions.

	* added a couple of checks in the anatGetAll function to compare the list of labels that was found in an input file and the labels that are defined in the mapping. If there are any discrepancies, that can lead to hard to debug problems...
