Statistics for MINC volumes: A library to integrate voxel-based statistics for MINC volumes into the R environment. 
Supports getting and writing of MINC volumes, running voxel-wise linear models, correlations, etc.; correcting for 
multiple comparisons using the False Discovery Rate, and more. With contributions from Jason Lerch, Jim Nikelski, 
Matthijs van Eede and Daniel Cassel. Some additional information can be found here:

Dependencies:

RMINC depends on the following repository:
https://github.com/Mouse-Imaging-Centre/minc-stuffs

Installation:

The R_LIBS variable determines where the library is installed. By default it will be installed under /usr/share. 
If you want to install the library somewhere else, the R_LIBS environment variable should be set.

> export R_LIBS=/build/directory

The latest version of the software using the devtools package (R 3.1.1) from within R:

> install.packages("devtools")
> library(devtools)
> options(devtools.install.args = "--configure-args='--with-build-path=/path/to/minc/install/root/directory/'")
> install_git("https://github.com/mcvaneede/RMINC")

The latest version of the software using command line tools:

$ git clone https://github.com/mcvaneede/RMINC.git RMINC
$ cd RMINC
$ ./autogen.sh
$ cd ../
$ R CMD INSTALL RMINC /directory/where/sourcefiles/go --preclean --configure-args='--with-build-path=/install/directory/minc2'


Installation of a release:

Download the tarball from the Github RMINC website https://github.com/mcvaneede/RMINC/tree/master/releases
Install the package (example is for the tarball version 0.5):

> R CMD INSTALL RMINC_0.5.tar.gz --configure-args='--with-build-path=/install/directory/minc2'
